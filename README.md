# Rolling Stone Clone *(reloaded)*
**Our first project in Develhope: a clone of Rolling Stone Magazine.**

In this project we used HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a static web page.

Take a look at the [preview](https://nico-barbieri.github.io/develhope-rollingstone-clone/).

**IMPORTANT:** *We noticed that online preview is mistakenly flagged as a phishing attempt by Avast (and maybe some other antivirus) due to the fact that it is a front-end clone of rollingstone.com. However, it is completely safe to use, and we are taking all necessary measures to resolve this issue as soon as possible.*
